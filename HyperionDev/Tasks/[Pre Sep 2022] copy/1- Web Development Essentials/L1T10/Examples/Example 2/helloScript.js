/* This code does more or less the same as the code in example.html. Notice that again we declare variables called name and age.
This time we also have 2 additional variable though: yearOfBith and thisYear. 
We use a predefined method called Date().getFullYear() to get the current year. This method
gets the year from your computer's date and time settings. See more about this method here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getFullYear

We then calculate how old a person is by subtracting the year they were born in from the current year. */
