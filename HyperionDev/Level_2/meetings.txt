 Each created list element should contain a span element with a class named close. Each span element should have a value of ‘\u00D7’, which represents the character ‘x’ in unicode.
■ As the last line of this function, call a function (described below) to delete an item from the shopping list.
■ Create a function which will update the grocery items array by getting the value of the text in the <input> tag and adding it to the array.
■ If the input text field is empty, display an alert to the user indicating that they should insert an item. Else, add the input text to the array.
■ Once the item has been added to the array or the alert displayed, reset the input text’s value to an empty string.
■ As the last line of this function, call the function created in the previous task to display the updated array items.
■ Create a function to delete items from both the array and the Shopping List display.
■ Add a click event listener to each <span> element with a close class — when the event is triggered, delete the item from the array and set the display style to none for the specific list parent element.
■ Add a click event listener to the html element with the ID of itemList.
■ If the event’s tag name is a list tag, toggle a checked class on the event element.
■ Add a key up event listener to the HTML element with an input ID.
■ If the event key code is equal to ‘13’ (the key code for the ‘Enter’ key), trigger a click() function on the element with an addButton ID.
○ CSS:
■ All elements with a checked class should have styling which
indicates that the item has been checked off the shopping list.
○ HTML:
■ Add an onclick attribute to the HTML element with an
addButton ID. When this element is clicked, the function which updates the shopping list should be called.
