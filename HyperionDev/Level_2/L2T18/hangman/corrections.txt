The user should be able to restart the game, especially once the game has been won or lost.

Please use comments to explain your code, such as describing what your functions/methods do and a top-level 
comment explaining what is happening in the file. Your comments will help the code to be understandable and 
maintainable and improve the quality of your submissions.

--- My Correcttions ---
(1) Added resetGame reducer at /store/hangmna.js and calling this reducer in 
    4.letterSelection/LetterSelection.js. which will restart the game if the player wins or losses.

(2) Reset Button. Makes use of the resetGame reducer at /store/hangmna.js, and is reated in the 6.ResetButton/ResetButton.js 
    file, which will reset the game once the user presses the button and set all the REDUX state to back to their default value.
