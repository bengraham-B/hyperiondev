(1) The benefits of using MongoDB include simple installation, MongoDB is cost effective, user recieve full technical support and MongDB offers its users
    a full cloud-based developer platform. ((1)https://www.mongodb.com
)
(2) In a schemaless database, information is sorted within a JSON-style document ((2)https://www.mongodb.com), and a schemeles database allows the
    user any data to be saved within within both indidaul fields and structures. 
    The pros of a schemaless database include the user having greater 
    flexibility over over the data types within their database ((3)https://www.mongodb.com). There is no data truncation, which means that the database will make 
    no changes to you data so your infotmation will be saved to its own documnet with its own partial schema which will thus ensure that your raw data is untocuhed as 
    nothing will be stripped away to match a pre-existing schema ((3)https://www.mongodb.com).
    The cons of a schemaless database include, there is no generally query language ((2)https://redis.com), there are stillmmany trouble shooting issues which 
    have not been documented ((2)https://redis.com) and there is inconsistencies in data retrievals due to their distriubted approach to storing data 
    ((2)https://redis.com).

(3) The reasons why companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and Netfilx use NoSQL database, firstly rational databases are not suited for andling the 
    expotiential growth in real-time data ((4)https://www.linkedin.com), NoSQL databases are also able to work well with current unstrucuterd data such as emails,
    documents and data releted to the main social media platforms ((4)https://www.linkedin.com) and NoSQL databases can be automatically spread across mutiple 
    servers ((4)https://www.linkedin.com). Lastly NoSQL databases are highly distributable through clusters of servers, which is then able to hold the database
    ((4)https://www.linkedin.com).


(4) An advatage over a rational database oppsed to a NoSQL database, is that a rational database has a generaly query language, SQL, which will allow the user to 
    easily retrive data from the database ((5)https://www.educba.com). Furthermore SQL allows users to quickly retive large amounts of data records fomr a 
    database ((6)https://www.scaler.com) and SQL is a standardised language ((6)https://www.scaler.com), which will allow users to work with mutiple rational
    datbase management systems (RDMS) such as MySQL, Oracle and Sybase ((7)https://www.solarwinds.com).
