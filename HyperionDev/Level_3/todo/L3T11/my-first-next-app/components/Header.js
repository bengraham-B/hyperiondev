/*Since Next.js is used to create server-rendered pages, adding a link using a normal <a> tag would cause a link that would be navigated to via the server. 
This is obviously not always necessary. 
To support client-side navigation (this takes place in the browser, without making a request to the server) we use Next.jsâ€™ Link API.*/
